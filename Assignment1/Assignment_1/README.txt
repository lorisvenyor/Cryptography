For running the command "java assignment1 assignment1.class > Encryption.txt"

    - I can only run this command once. Second and follwing runs return an overriding existing file error. I'm using bash so instead of using ">", I use ">|" to redirect my output to the Encryption.txt
    - see link here about ">|" https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/45201/bash-what-does-do
